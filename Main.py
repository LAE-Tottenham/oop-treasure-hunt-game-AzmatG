#get spawned into the lobby
#LOBBY => Trader and maze
# Trader is a simple symbol First time engages an introduction but afterwars just engages events
#Maze => Calls PlayerExplore IF THIS BREAKS GET SPAWNED BACK TO LOBBY => if maze.level > 0 make it so you can choose from level 0 -> current
#Else Just continue the explortion
#Once lvl4 is completed, initiate boss battle
#if win, have little dialogue and lore and break story and finish => GOOD END
#IF lose, Have a shocking convo with boss, they can talk, beckons you to join => if you do => hidden end else: die (bad end)
