#has a player and an enemy
#takes an input from player and random move from enemy
#needs a store for all moves
#ChooseAction state
#ImplementAction state
#keep track of health
#Have a reset fight option or lose game
#In the while loop make sure it shows a little display for health
#1) Needs a base state
#2) inheriting from it is chooseaction state and implement action state
#3) statemachine holding all states and curretn state
#4) transition state => Change state when recieved correct input
#5) a main loop for choices and interface and actual combat inherits statemachine
#6) choose state needs to constanlty check healths so win or lose will be shown in choose state
# choose state fleshing out:
#Needs to give feedback on player health, perhaps giving advice on moves for moves
# Have 5 options of moves => Attack, defend, view player, view enemy, items
# Choose state only ends if you commit to an attack or defend
# attack => simply asks whether you wish to attack the enemy
# defend => simply asks whetehr you wish to attack the enemy
# view player =? views player stats
# view enemy => view enemy stats
# items => consumable for health
